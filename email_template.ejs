    <p>
      How's life treating you? I'm doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked. I'm spending all my time learning to code at Fullstack Academy.  It's a lot of work, but I'm enjoying it!

      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
      Check out my new posts here:    
      <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
         <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %> > <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a>  </li>
      <% } %>
    </ul>
    </p>

      Talk soon,<br>
